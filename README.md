# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

## Setup
1) [Clone repo locally](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2) Ensure that [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed
3) Create a directory at the root of this project that will contain files of text (IE: Books found in the public domain)

## Usage:
- To run, use the command: `python3 main.py <path_to_book>`
  - IE: `python3 main.py books/book_found_in_the_public_domain.txt`
